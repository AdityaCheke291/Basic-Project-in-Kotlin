     * OOPS :- Object Oriented Programming System
     * A programming paradigm that uses the concept of classes and objects.
     * IN OOPS we had class & Objects
     * Properties and functions
     *
     * Classes are the blueprint of the objects. WHere we put both variable and function
     *
     * Four Main Principles of OOP
     * Encapsulation :-  it is encapsulating data and function together
     * Inheritance :- it means we can use the property and function of one class to another class
     * Abstraction :- It means hiding ( when we design a system we had to hide something and visible whenever it's necessary)
     * Polymorphism :- We will design a classes in a way that we can reuse the same function to achieve different behaviour's and different classes

     * Kotlin Inheritance :- deriving or creating another class using existence class
     * Now this derived class inherit the properties of the parent class. that will allow us to use the existing implementation of the parent class
     * Inheritance helps us in code reusable.
     *
     * All the classes in kotlin are final by default so if you want to integrate a class you need to inherit the class you
        had to tell them we had to inherit this class
     * open is used to make the class inheritable, now you can inherit this class in the another class

        had to tell them we had to inherit this class for that make the class as open
     *  If some properties are private then you cannot access them in the child classes
