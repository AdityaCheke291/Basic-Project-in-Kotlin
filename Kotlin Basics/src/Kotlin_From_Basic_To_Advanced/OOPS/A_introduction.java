    /**
     * OOPS :- Object Oriented Programming System
     * A programming paradigm that uses the concept of classes and objects.
     * IN OOPS we had class & Objects
     * Properties and functions
     *
     * Classes are the blueprint of the objects. WHere we put both variable and function
     *
     * Four Main Principles of OOP
     * Encapsulation :-  it is encapsulating data and function together
     * Inheritance :- it means we can use the property and function of one class to another class
     * Abstraction :- It means hiding ( when we design a system we had to hide something and visible whenever it's necessary)
     * Polymorphism :- We will design a classes in a way that we can reuse the same function to achieve different behaviour's and different classes
